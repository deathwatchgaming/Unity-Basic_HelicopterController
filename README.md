![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deathwatchgaming/Unity-Basic_HelicopterController/refs/heads/main/Previews/Helicopter-SideView1.png)


Release Intentions Note:
------------------------

The intention of this release was to provide basic vehicle functionality as a starting point as base fully functional in terms of an opinion of basic but leave out optional continuances in the hopes that this will be used as starting point / base for folks to then as such continue on with and improve upon.


NOTE: This project was developed while / for using Unity 2021+ & 2022+ & Unity 6

NOTE: This currently uses the "Old Input System" as well as provides "New Input System" variants so noting as such depending on what version of Unity you may be using it may be necessary to make sure such
or both is enabled in project settings.

Also note: currently while there are new input system variants provided, some of the related documentations for those still have old documentations in such such and still need to be edited to reflect any such setup changes and will be edited hopefully soon as some further free time allows.
